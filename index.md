# Study Cycles

**Updates:** see **[NEWS / update log]({{ site.baseurl }}/updates/)**.

I maintain this section as a living study archive—my way of learning the literature deeply and systematically across the core fields that shape modern financial economics. The goal is mastery through repetition: reading, re-deriving, reorganizing, and returning until the key ideas become intuitive and usable.

## Method: the 7-day loop (Saturday = review)
I study in repeating seven-day cycles. Each week is a complete loop, and **Saturday is reserved for review**: consolidating notes, reconnecting ideas across topics, and updating reading maps. I then restart the cycle—refining summaries, re-deriving core results, and iterating until the foundations are internalized.

## Materials
- **[Micro](materials/micro/)** — preferences, uncertainty, general equilibrium, mechanisms
- **[Macro](materials/macro/)** — growth, business cycles, monetary frameworks
- **[Econometrics](materials/econometrics/)** — identification, estimation, inference, robustness
- **[Math Foundations](materials/math-foundations/)** — linear algebra, probability, optimization, analysis
- **[Empirical IO](materials/eio/)** — demand, costs, conduct, entry/exit, counterfactual analysis
- **[Asset Pricing (Theory)](materials/ap-theory/)** — SDF, no-arbitrage, equilibrium pricing
- **[Asset Pricing (Empirical)](materials/ap-empirical/)** — factors, predictability, anomalies, methods
- **[Corporate Finance (Theory)](materials/cf-theory/)** — contracting, capital structure, governance
- **[Corporate Finance (Empirical)](materials/cf-empirical/)** — causal designs, measurement, firm behavior
- **[Macro-Finance](materials/macro-finance/)** — risk premia, term structure, policy transmission

## Use these materials
If this study style—or any of the materials here—ends up being helpful, you’re very welcome to **join me**, **reuse the notes**, or **adapt the structure** in whatever way fits your learning goals.
