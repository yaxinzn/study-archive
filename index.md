# Study Cycles: Notes, Materials, and Weekly Reviews

I maintain this section as a living study archive—my way of learning the literature deeply and systematically across the core fields that shape modern financial economics. The materials here cover microeconomics, macroeconomics, econometrics, empirical industrial organization, asset pricing (theory and empirics), corporate finance (theory and empirics), and macro-finance. My method is simple but strict: I study in repeating seven-day cycles. Each week runs as a complete loop, and Friday is intentionally different from the other days—it is reserved for review, consolidation, and reconnecting ideas across topics. I then restart the cycle, refining notes, re-deriving key results, and updating reading maps until each area becomes internalized. If this study style—or any of the materials here—ends up being helpful to you, you’re very welcome to join me, reuse the notes, or adapt the structure in whatever way fits your own learning goals.
