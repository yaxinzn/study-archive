# Math Foundations

## Purpose
This section consolidates the mathematical toolkit that repeatedly appears across micro, macro, econometrics, empirical IO, and asset pricing. The goal is to keep prerequisites in one place so later derivations and proofs remain clean, fast, and consistent.

## Coverage
- **Linear algebra:** vector spaces, projections, eigenvalues/eigenvectors, matrix decompositions
- **Probability & statistics:** random variables, conditioning, convergence, LLN/CLT, basic inequalities
- **Optimization:** unconstrained/constrained problems, KKT conditions, envelope theorem, duality
- **Real analysis essentials:** limits, continuity, differentiation, Taylor expansions
- **Stochastic processes (as needed):** martingales, Brownian motion, Itô’s lemma
